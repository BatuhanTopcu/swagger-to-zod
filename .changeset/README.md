# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

## Adding a changeset

When you make changes to this project, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the type of change (patch, minor, major)
2. Write a summary of the changes

A new markdown file will be created in this folder describing your changes. Commit this file along with your code changes.

## What happens next

When changes are pushed to the `master` branch:

1. A GitHub Action will create a "Version Packages" PR
2. This PR updates the version in `package.json` and generates `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Merging that PR creates a GitHub Release with the extension builds attached

For more information, see the [changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).
